## Description
This project explores global air quality using the WHO Ambient Air Quality Database. Using R, we use our EDA that we carried out in Assessment 0 and further literary research we have carried out. In our introduction we outline our goals and summarise any important EDA that led to our conclusion. 
We created an artificial competition environment where we each competed to create the best model to predict pm10_concentration for 2021, using data from cities in Europe (we justify our choice in our intro).

Throughout this project, we demonstrated the ability to:
- Examined regional and population - based trends,
- Explored correlations between pollutants,
- Modelled pollution levels against potential covariates,
- Used visualisations to highlight global patterns and data coverage differences.

Our work demonstrates skills in modelling, optimisation, visualisation and modelling in R within the context of enviromental data science. 

Our conclusions can be found in the 'Conclusion.Rmd' file.
